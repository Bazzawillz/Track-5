Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "check, check out my melody"
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope for a four finger ring
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate It or Love It, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
